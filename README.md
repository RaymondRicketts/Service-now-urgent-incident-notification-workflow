The purpose of the workflow is to allow for automatic notifications to be set to the Network Operation Team when a critical incident is created. The issue with the incident that needed to be fixed was to specify the team that the notification needed to be sent to. On a larger scale, an AI agent could be used to dynamically route critical incident reports to the correct team. An agent could also be used to give recommendations to users on how to fix issues if the priority is low. Allowing for the AI to fuction with higher priority levels could have unforseen consqeuences.
